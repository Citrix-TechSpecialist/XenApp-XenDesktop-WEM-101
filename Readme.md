[Module 2 - Configuration Deployment](./Module2)

**Objective**

In this lab, you will discover how to build a snappy user experience, increase user density on any XenApp, XenDesktop environment, and learn how to manage a fast logon time (<15 s)
You will:

-	Learn how to configure CPU/RAM/IOPS optimizations
-	Learn how to replace user GPPs and login scripts
